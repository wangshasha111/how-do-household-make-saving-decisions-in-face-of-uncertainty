# How Do Households Make Saving Decisions Under Uncertainty?


## Goals
This project is for the structural estimation of a life-cycle model ([Ayagari 1994](https://github.com/wangshasha111/project_dirk_econ712/blob/master/AyagariQJE1994.pdf)).

The computation consists of two parts - partial equilibrium and general equilibrium, in the forms of both finite horizon and infinite horizon.

The project description can be found in [Project_description.pdf](https://github.com/wangshasha111/project_dirk_econ712/blob/master/Project_description.pdf). 

## Outputs
I output a [writeup](https://github.com/wangshasha111/project_dirk_econ712/tree/master/project_writeup) folder containing the tex file and the PDF file.
